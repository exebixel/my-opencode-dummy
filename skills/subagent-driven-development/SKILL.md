# Subagent-Driven Development

Execute plan by dispatching a fresh implementer subagent per task, a task review (spec compliance + code quality) after each, and a broad whole-branch review at the end.

**Why subagents:** You delegate tasks to specialized agents with isolated context. By precisely crafting their instructions and context, you ensure they stay focused and succeed at their task. They should never inherit your session's context or history — you construct exactly what they need. This also preserves your own context for coordination work.

**Core principle:** Fresh subagent per task + task review (spec + quality) + broad final review = high quality, fast iteration

**Narration:** between tool calls, narrate at most one short line — the
ledger and the tool results carry the record.

**Continuous execution:** Do not pause to check in with your human partner between tasks. Execute all tasks from the plan without stopping. The only reasons to stop are: BLOCKED status you cannot resolve, ambiguity that genuinely prevents progress, or all tasks complete. "Should I continue?" prompts and progress summaries waste their time — they asked you to execute the plan, so execute it.

**Commits are gated by plan scope.** This workflow is built on per-task
commits — the review package is a `BASE..HEAD` diff, the ledger tracks
commit hashes, and the whole pipeline assumes a clean commit history
per task. That makes committing load-bearing here, not optional. The
default is therefore **do not commit**; commits only happen when the
plan's scope explicitly authorizes producing committed code (e.g.,
"implement X with tests on a feature branch"). If the plan is about
research, exploration, design, drafting, or any task that does not
call for committed code, this skill is the wrong tool — stop, escalate
to your human partner, and either narrow the plan to authorize commits
or pick a different workflow. If you proceed with commits when the
plan did not authorize them, you have produced git history the user
did not ask for; that is a real cost, not a formality.

## When to Use

```dot
digraph when_to_use {
    "Have implementation plan?" [shape=diamond];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" [shape=diamond];
    "Stay in this session?" [shape=diamond];
    "subagent-driven-development" [shape=box];
    "executing-plans" [shape=box];
    "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [shape=box];

    "Have implementation plan?" -> "Tasks mostly independent?" [label="yes"];
    "Have implementation plan?" -> "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [label="no"];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" -> "Stay in this session?" [label="yes"];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" -> "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [label="no - tightly coupled"];
    "Stay in this session?" -> "subagent-driven-development" [label="yes"];
    "Stay in this session?" -> "executing-plans" [label="no - parallel session"];
}
```

**vs. Executing Plans (parallel session):**
- Same session (no context switch)
- Fresh subagent per task (no context pollution)
- Review after each task (spec compliance + code quality), broad review at the end
- Faster iteration (no human-in-loop between tasks)

}
```

## Setup

**Verify the plan authorizes commits before doing anything else.** Read
the plan's task descriptions and global constraints: does the scope
include producing committed code on a branch, or is it research /
exploration / design / drafting? If commits are not in scope, this
workflow is the wrong tool — stop, tell the human partner, and either
narrow the plan to authorize commits or pick a different approach
(scratch workspace, uncommitted working tree, etc.). Do not "soften"
the rule by letting the implementer commit anyway; review packages,
the ledger, and the loop all depend on a clean per-task commit
history. If commits are in scope, also confirm the target branch
before dispatching.

Ensure the work happens in an isolated workspace. Never start implementation
on a main/master branch without your human partner's explicit consent.

Conversation memory does not survive compaction. In real sessions,
controllers that lost their place have re-dispatched entire completed task
sequences — the single most expensive failure observed. Track progress in
a ledger file, not only in todos.

- Each plan owns a workspace: a git-ignored directory at
  `<repo-root>/.sdd/<plan-basename>/`, home to every artifact
  for THIS plan: ledger, briefs, reports, review packages. Create it
  before the first dispatch. Another plan's directory is never yours to
  read or write.
- Resolve and print the plan's git-ignored workspace with:
  ```bash
  slug=$(basename "PLAN_FILE" .md)
  root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
  base="$root/.sdd"
  dir="$base/$slug"
  mkdir -p "$dir"
  printf '*\n' > "$base/.gitignore"
  echo "$dir"
  ```
  The workspace holds the ledger, briefs, reports, and review packages for this plan.
- Check for this plan's ledger at `<workspace>/progress.md`. If its first
  line names your plan file, tasks with a `Task <N>: complete` line are DONE
  — do not re-dispatch them; resume at the first task without one. A task
  whose last line is a fix round is mid-loop: resume the loop at the next
  round. A ledger whose first line names a different plan file — or a stray
  ledger at the old flat path `.sdd/progress.md` — is another
  plan's progress: leave it in place and start your own, fresh.
- Create the ledger with its identity as the first line:
  `# SDD ledger — plan: <plan file path>`.
- The ledger is your recovery map: the commits it names exist in git even
  when your context no longer remembers creating them. After compaction,
  trust the ledger and `git log` over your own recollection.
- `git clean -fdx` will destroy the workspace (it's git-ignored scratch); if
  that happens, recover from `git log`.

Read the plan once, note its context and Global Constraints, and create a
todo per task.

Before dispatching Task 1, scan the plan once for conflicts:

- tasks that contradict each other or the plan's Global Constraints
- anything the plan explicitly mandates that the review rubric treats as a
  defect (a test that asserts nothing, verbatim duplication of a logic block)

Present everything you find to your human partner as one batched question —
each finding beside the plan text that mandates it, asking which governs —
before execution begins, not one interrupt per discovery mid-plan. If the
scan is clean, proceed without comment. The review loop remains the net for
conflicts that only emerge from implementation.

## Model Selection

Use the least powerful model that can handle each role to conserve cost and increase speed.

**Mechanical implementation tasks** (isolated functions, clear specs, 1-2 files): use a fast, cheap model. Most implementation tasks are mechanical when the plan is well-specified.

**Integration and judgment tasks** (multi-file coordination, pattern matching, debugging): use a standard model.

**Architecture and design tasks**: use the most capable available model.
The final whole-branch review is one of these — dispatch it on the most
capable available model, not the session default.

**Review tasks**: choose the model with the same judgment, scaled to the
diff's size, complexity, and risk. A small mechanical diff does not need the
most capable model; a subtle concurrency change does. Scoped re-reviews of
small fix diffs take a cheap-to-mid tier.

**Fix-loop escalation (rounds 4-5)**: use a model at least one tier above
the implementer that got stuck.

**Always specify the model explicitly when dispatching a subagent.** An
omitted model inherits your session's model — often the most capable and
most expensive — which silently defeats this section.

**Turn count beats token price.** Wall-clock and context cost scale with how
many turns a subagent takes, and the cheapest models routinely take 2-3× the
turns on multi-step work — costing more overall. Use a mid-tier model as the
floor for reviewers and for implementers working from prose descriptions.
When the task's plan text contains the complete code to write, the
implementation is transcription plus testing: use the cheapest tier for
that implementer. Single-file mechanical fixes also take the cheapest tier.

**Task complexity signals (implementation tasks):**
- Touches 1-2 files with a complete spec → cheap model
- Touches multiple files with integration concerns → standard model
- Requires design judgment or broad codebase understanding → most capable model

## The Task Loop

Everything you paste into a dispatch prompt — and everything a subagent
prints back — stays resident in your context for the rest of the session
and is re-read on every later turn. Hand artifacts over as files.

### 1. Dispatch the implementer

Record BASE (`git rev-parse HEAD`) before dispatching — the review package
and fix-round diffs need it.

- **Task brief:** before dispatching an implementer, extract the task's
  full text from the plan into a uniquely named file at
  `<workspace>/task-N-brief.md` so the task text never has to be pasted
  through the controller's context. Compose the dispatch so the brief
  stays the single source of requirements. Your dispatch should contain:
  (1) one line on where this task fits in the project; (2) the brief path,
  introduced as "read this first — it is your requirements, with the exact
  values to use verbatim"; (3) interfaces and decisions from earlier
  tasks that the brief cannot know; (4) your resolution of any ambiguity
  you noticed in the brief; (5) the report-file path and report contract.
  Exact values (numbers, magic strings, signatures, test cases) appear
  only in the brief. Never make a subagent read the whole plan file.
  Extract the task's full text into `<workspace>/task-N-brief.md` with:
  ```bash
  plan="PLAN_FILE"; n="N"
  slug=$(basename "$plan" .md)
  root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
  dir="$root/.sdd/$slug"
  out="$dir/task-${n}-brief.md"
  awk -v n="$n" '
    /^```/ { infence = !infence }
    !infence && /^#+[ \t]+Task[ \t]+[0-9]+/ {
      intask = ($0 ~ ("^#+[ \t]+Task[ \t]+" n "([^0-9]|$)"))
    }
    intask { print }
  ' "$plan" > "$out"
  echo "$out"
  ```
  The brief is the implementer's single source of requirements.
- **Report file:** name the implementer's report file after the brief
  (brief `…/task-N-brief.md` → report `…/task-N-report.md`) and put it in
  the dispatch prompt. The implementer writes the full report there and
  returns only status, commits, a one-line test summary, and concerns.
- A dispatch prompt describes one task, not the session's history. Do not
  paste accumulated prior-task summaries ("state after Tasks 1-3") into
  later dispatches — a real session's dispatch hit 42k chars of which 99%
  was pasted history. A fresh subagent needs its task, the interfaces it
  touches, and the global constraints. Nothing else.
- If an earlier task parked a finding in the area this task touches, carry
  a pointer to that ledger entry in the dispatch.
- Record the implementer's agent identity from the dispatch result —
  fix-loop rounds 1-3 resume this agent.
- Never dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel (conflicts).

### 2. Handle the report

Implementer subagents report one of four statuses. Handle each appropriately:

**DONE:** Generate the review package (commit list, stat summary, and the
full diff with extended context — written to
`<workspace>/review-<base7>..<head7>.diff` so it never enters the
controller's context; BASE is the commit you recorded before dispatching
the implementer — never `HEAD~1`, which silently drops all but the last
commit of a multi-commit task), then dispatch the task reviewer with the
printed path.

**DONE_WITH_CONCERNS:** The implementer completed the work but flagged doubts. Read the concerns before proceeding. If the concerns are about correctness or scope, address them before review. If they're observations (e.g., "this file is getting large"), note them and proceed to review.

**NEEDS_CONTEXT:** The implementer needs information that wasn't provided. Provide the missing context and re-dispatch.

**BLOCKED:** The implementer cannot complete the task. Assess the blocker:
1. If it's a context problem, provide more context and re-dispatch with the same model
2. If the task requires more reasoning, re-dispatch with a more capable model
3. If the task is too large, break it into smaller pieces
4. If the plan itself is wrong, escalate to the human

**Never** ignore an escalation or force the same model to retry without changes. If the implementer said it's stuck, something needs to change.

If the implementer asks questions — before starting or mid-task — answer
clearly and completely, provide additional context if needed, and don't
rush it into implementation.

### 3. Review the task

Per-task reviews are task-scoped gates. The broad review happens once, at the
final whole-branch review. Never skip the task review, and never accept a
report missing either verdict — spec compliance AND task quality are both
required. Implementer self-review never replaces the task review; both are
needed.

- Hand the reviewer its diff as a file: assemble the commit list, stat
  summary, and full diff with extended context for the range BASE..HEAD
  into one uniquely named file at
  `<workspace>/review-<base7>..<head7>.diff`. The output never enters your
  own context, and the reviewer sees the commit list, stat summary, and
  full diff with context in one read. Use the BASE you recorded before
  dispatching the implementer — never `HEAD~1`, which silently truncates
  multi-commit tasks. Never dispatch a task reviewer without a diff file.
  Write the review package to `<workspace>/review-<base7>..<head7>.diff` with:
  ```bash
  plan="PLAN_FILE"; base="BASE"; head="HEAD"
  slug=$(basename "$plan" .md)
  root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
  dir="$root/.sdd/$slug"
  base7=$(git rev-parse --short "$base")
  head7=$(git rev-parse --short "$head")
  out="$dir/review-${base7}..${head7}.diff"
  {
    echo "# Review package: ${base}..${head}"
    echo
    echo "## Commits"
    git log --oneline "${base}..${head}"
    echo
    echo "## Files changed"
    git diff --stat "${base}..${head}"
    echo
    echo "## Diff"
    git diff -U10 "${base}..${head}"
  } > "$out"
  echo "$out"
  ```
  Pass the printed path to the reviewer.
- **Reviewer inputs:** the task reviewer gets three paths — the same brief
  file, the report file, and the review package — plus the global
  constraints that bind the task.
- The global-constraints block you hand the reviewer is its attention
  lens. Copy the binding requirements verbatim from the plan's Global
  Constraints section or the spec: exact values, exact formats, and the
  stated relationships between components ("same layout as X", "matches
  Y"). The reviewer's prompt already carries the process rules (YAGNI,
  test hygiene, review method) — the constraints block is for what THIS
  project's spec demands.
- Do not add open-ended directives like "check all uses" or "run race tests
  if useful" without a concrete, task-specific reason
- Do not ask a reviewer to re-run tests the implementer already ran on the
  same code — the implementer's report carries the test evidence
- Do not pre-judge findings for the reviewer — never instruct a reviewer to
  ignore or not flag a specific issue. If you believe a finding would be a
  false positive, let the reviewer raise it and adjudicate it in the review
  loop. If the prompt you are writing contains "do not flag," "don't treat X
  as a defect," "at most Minor," or "the plan chose" — stop: you are
  pre-judging, usually to spare yourself a review loop.
The task reviewer may report "⚠️ Cannot verify from diff" items — requirements
that live in unchanged code or span tasks. These do not block the rest of the
review, but you must resolve each one yourself before marking the task
complete: you hold the plan and cross-task context the reviewer
lacks. If you confirm an item is a real gap, treat it as a failed spec
review — it enters the fix loop with the other findings.

### 4. The fix loop

The loop triggers when the review reports spec ❌, any Critical or Important
finding, or a ⚠️ item you confirmed as a real gap.

Before the loop starts, two routes leave it immediately:

- Record Minor findings in the progress ledger as you go
  (`Task <N>: minor (deferred): <one-liner>`), and point the final
  whole-branch review at that list so it can triage which must be fixed
  before merge. A roll-up nobody reads is a silent discard. Minor findings
  never enter the loop.
- A finding labeled plan-mandated — or any finding that conflicts with
  what the plan's text requires — is the human's decision, like any plan
  contradiction: present the finding and the plan text, ask which governs.
  Do not dismiss the finding because the plan mandates it, and do not
  dispatch a fix that contradicts the plan without asking.
Everything else enters the loop. A fix round is one fix dispatch plus one
scoped re-review. Five rounds maximum per task:

**Rounds 1-3 — resume the original implementer.** Send it the open findings
verbatim. Its context is intact: it knows the task, the code, and its own
choices. If your harness cannot send another message to a live subagent,
dispatch a fresh implementer carrying the brief path, the report-file path,
and the findings — the report file is the persistent memory either way.

**Rounds 4-5 — dispatch a fresh implementer on a more capable model** (per
Model Selection), with the brief path, the report-file path, the open
findings, and this framing: "A prior implementer attempted this task
[N] times; you own it now. Read the report file for what was tried." A loop
that survives three resumes usually means the implementer cannot see its
own problem — fresh eyes and a capability bump in one move.

**Every round, either way:** the implementer fixes, re-runs the tests
covering the amended code, appends its fix report to the same report file,
and returns the short contract. Before re-dispatching the reviewer, confirm
the fix report contains the covering tests, the command run, and the
output; dispatch the re-review once all three are present. Name the
covering test files in the fix message — a one-line fix does not need the
whole suite.

**The re-review is scoped.** Write a fresh review package over the fix range
(FIX_BASE = the head the previous review saw, HEAD = the new tip):
  ```bash
  plan="PLAN_FILE"; base="FIX_BASE"; head="HEAD"
  slug=$(basename "$plan" .md)
  root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
  dir="$root/.sdd/$slug"
  base7=$(git rev-parse --short "$base")
  head7=$(git rev-parse --short "$head")
  out="$dir/review-${base7}..${head7}.diff"
  {
    echo "# Review package: ${base}..${head}"
    echo
    echo "## Commits"
    git log --oneline "${base}..${head}"
    echo
    echo "## Files changed"
    git diff --stat "${base}..${head}"
    echo
    echo "## Diff"
    git diff -U10 "${base}..${head}"
  } > "$out"
  echo "$out"
  ```
Then dispatch the re-reviewer with the findings list, the brief, the report
file, and the printed diff path. The re-reviewer verdicts each finding
ADDRESSED or NOT ADDRESSED and flags new breakage in the fix diff only.
New Critical/Important breakage in the fix diff joins the open findings
list. Out-of-scope observations go to the ledger as deferred minors —
they never extend the loop.

**After each round,** append to the ledger:
`Task <N>: fix round <R>/5 (<X> addressed, <Y> open — <finding one-liners>; commits <a7>..<b7>)`

Never fix findings yourself in the controller session — your context stays
clean for coordination, and controller fixes skip review.

**The breaker.** When round 5's re-review still leaves findings open, stop
dispatching. Adjudicate each open finding yourself — you hold the plan and
the cross-task context the reviewer lacks:

- **The reviewer is wrong, or the point is contestable:** park it —
  `Task <N>: parked — <finding> — ruling: <why the code stands>`. The final
  review sees both sides.
- **Real, but nothing downstream builds on it:** park it the same way, with
  a ruling that says it's real and deferred.
- **Real and load-bearing** — a later task builds on it, or it reveals a
  plan defect: STOP. Append `Task <N>: BLOCKED — <reason>` and report to
  your human partner with the finding, the plan text it collides with, and
  the fix history. Parking a structural failure lets every dependent task
  build on it and hands the final review a problem it cannot fix either.

Adjudicate only at the cap. Adjudicating earlier to end a loop is
pre-judging with a different name. Every adjudication is a ledger entry —
a silent discard is forbidden.

### 5. Complete the task

When the review comes back clean — or every open finding is parked with a
ruling at the cap — append the completion line to the ledger in the same
message as your other bookkeeping:

- `Task <N>: complete (commits <base7>..<head7>, review clean)`
- `Task <N>: complete (commits <base7>..<head7>, <K> parked)` after a
  tripped breaker

Then mark the todo complete and move on. Never move to the next task while
the review has open Critical/Important issues that are neither fixed nor
parked-with-ruling at the cap.

## Final Review

The final whole-branch review gets a package too: write a review package over
the full branch range (MERGE_BASE = the commit the branch started from, e.g.
`git merge-base main HEAD`, up to HEAD):
  ```bash
  plan="PLAN_FILE"; base="MERGE_BASE"; head="HEAD"
  slug=$(basename "$plan" .md)
  root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
  dir="$root/.sdd/$slug"
  base7=$(git rev-parse --short "$base")
  head7=$(git rev-parse --short "$head")
  out="$dir/review-${base7}..${head7}.diff"
  {
    echo "# Review package: ${base}..${head}"
    echo
    echo "## Commits"
    git log --oneline "${base}..${head}"
    echo
    echo "## Files changed"
    git diff --stat "${base}..${head}"
    echo
    echo "## Diff"
    git diff -U10 "${base}..${head}"
  } > "$out"
  echo "$out"
  ```
Include the printed path in the final review dispatch, so the final reviewer
reads one file instead of re-deriving the branch diff with git commands.
Dispatch on the most capable available model (see Model Selection), using the
requesting-code-review skill's code-reviewer prompt as the
review template. Point it at the ledger's deferred-minor and parked
lines so it can triage which must be fixed before merge.

If the final whole-branch review returns findings, dispatch ONE fix subagent
with the complete findings list — not one fixer per finding.
Per-finding fixers each rebuild context and re-run suites; a real
session's final-review fix wave cost more than all its tasks combined.
Then run exactly one scoped re-review of the fix wave (review package over
the fix range, dispatched to the re-reviewer).
Adjudicate any residual findings as in the task loop's breaker: park with
rulings, or stop on load-bearing ones. There is no second fix wave —
residual load-bearing findings surface to your human partner when
finishing-a-development-branch presents the options.

## Finish

When the final whole-branch review is clean and its fixes are merged,
delete this plan's workspace (`rm -rf <workspace>`) — the git history is
the record now. Sibling directories belong to other plans; leave them
alone.

Use finishing-a-development-branch.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Close enough on spec compliance" | Reviewer found spec gaps = not done. Fix or hit the cap and adjudicate — those are the only exits. |
| "I'll fix it myself, dispatching is overhead" | Controller fixes pollute your context and skip review. Resume the implementer. |
| "One more round will converge" | Past the cap, rounds don't converge — the failure is structural. Adjudicate and route. |
| "The reviewer will just find something new anyway" | Scoped re-reviews verify fixes; they cannot wander. New findings on untouched code go to the ledger, not the loop. |
| "This finding is obviously wrong, I'll drop it" | You adjudicate only at the cap, and every ruling is a ledger entry. Silent discards are forbidden. |
| "The fix was small, skip the re-review" | Unreviewed fixes are how regressions land. Every round ends with a scoped re-review. |
| "Reviews slow the loop down" | The loop without reviews is just unverified churn. Reviews are the loop's brakes and steering. |
| "Ledger bookkeeping is overhead" | The ledger is what survives compaction. Controllers without one have re-dispatched entire completed task sequences. |
| "The plan is exploratory but committing is harmless" | Commits in this workflow are load-bearing — the review package, the ledger, and the per-task loop all assume a clean commit history. Extra commits you weren't asked to make are real git history the user did not authorize, and they distort the review range. Verify scope first; if the plan does not authorize commits, this is the wrong skill. |
| "The plan didn't say to commit, but every task naturally lands one" | "Naturally" is the loophole. Per-task commits exist because the workflow requires them — when the plan does not authorize commits, "naturally" means the implementer is doing work the plan did not ask for. Stop, escalate, do not commit. |
| "I'll commit then ask for forgiveness" | Undoable history in shared branches is a real cost. The default is no commit; the plan must opt in. Asking first is cheap, asking forgiveness for unrequested history is not. |

## Example Workflow

```
You: I'm using Subagent-Driven Development to execute this plan.

[Setup: workspace verified]
[Read plan file once: docs/plans/feature-plan.md]
[Resolve workspace: create .sdd/feature-plan/ — no ledger inside, fresh start]
[Track tasks in todo list]

Task 1: Hook installation script

[Extract task 1 brief to <workspace>/task-1-brief.md; dispatch implementer with brief + report paths + context]

Implementer: "Before I begin - should the hook be installed at user or system level?"

You: "User level (~/.config/hooks/)"

Implementer: [Later]
  - Implemented install-hook command
  - Added tests, 5/5 passing
  - Self-review: Found I missed --force flag, added it
  - Committed

[Generate review package <workspace>/review-base..head.diff; dispatch task reviewer with the printed path]
Task reviewer: Spec ✅ - all requirements met, nothing extra.
  Strengths: Good test coverage, clean. Issues: None. Task quality: Approved.

[Ledger: Task 1: complete (commits a1b2c3d..d4e5f6a, review clean)]

Task 2: Recovery modes

[Extract task 2 brief to <workspace>/task-2-brief.md; dispatch implementer with brief + report paths + context]

Implementer: [No questions]
  - Added verify/repair modes
  - 8/8 tests passing
  - Committed

[Generate review package <workspace>/review-base..head.diff; dispatch task reviewer with the printed path]
Task reviewer: Spec ❌:
  - Missing: Progress reporting (spec says "report every 100 items")
  Issues (Important): Magic number (100)

[Fix round 1: resume the implementer with both findings]
Implementer: Added progress reporting, extracted PROGRESS_INTERVAL constant.
  Re-ran test/recovery.test.js — 10/10 passing. Fix report appended.

[Generate review package <workspace>/review-fix_base..head.diff; dispatch scoped re-review]
Re-reviewer: Missing progress reporting — ADDRESSED (src/recovery.js:41).
  Magic number — ADDRESSED (src/recovery.js:7). New breakage: none.
  Verdict: all findings addressed.

[Ledger: Task 2: fix round 1/5 (2 addressed, 0 open; commits d4e5f6a..b7c8d9e)]
[Ledger: Task 2: complete (commits d4e5f6a..b7c8d9e, review clean)]

...

[After all tasks]
[Generate review package <workspace>/review-merge_base..head.diff; dispatch final code-reviewer, most capable model]
Final reviewer: All requirements met. Deferred minors triaged: none block merge.

[Delete this plan's workspace — the record now lives in git]

Done! Using finishing-a-development-branch.
